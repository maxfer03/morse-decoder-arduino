# morse-reader-arduino
After playing around for some hours with an old arduino, I decided to try and create my own program from scratch. This program reads input from the serial monitor and reproduces it using an LED light.

To run it, simply open it with the Arduino IDE.

I made a circuit on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0JnKyzlSSRC-morse-reader) if you want to see it working!

# Requirements
Probably there's an easier way of wiring this, my electronics knowledge is still quite basic.
- Arduino UNO Board
- One LED light
- One Breadboard
- 3 Male to male wires
- 1 resistence
